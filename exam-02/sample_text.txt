Nowadays, many people think that there is nothing better than to read a good book. However, there are others who would rather prefer to watch a film version.
As far as I am concerned, it is more useful and enjoyable to spend time with a great book. First of all, you can take a great interest in reading. It can help you to escape from your everyday problems and boring routine. It is just like some kind of door to a new world, where you can go when you are tired of reality. Secondly, some good books can help you develop your imagination. You create a story in your mind while reading. You can even picture faces of main characters, location, all scenes inwardly. Thirdly, reading gives you time to think about main ideas of a book. It is a chance to consider and make a conclusion about a plot of a book independently.
Nevertheless, it has become fashionable for some people to argue that it is better to watch a film version of a book. They claim that it takes less time, so you can watch more films and know more stories.
I disagree with this opinion, because these people fail to understand that you just cannot find out a full plot from a film, because in a film version of a book many details are cut out.
To sum up, I want to say that going to the cinema is a wonderful thing, but if you go to the film with an adapted script, you should read the book at first.
